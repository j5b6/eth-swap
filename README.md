# eth-swap
A cryptocurrency exchange that allows the swapping (buying and selling) of Ethereum for a natively created DApp token
The project contains two smart contracts.
Firstly, a ERC20 DApp token.
Secondly, a smart contract that allows for the swapping of Ethereum and DApp token for each other.
The smart contracts have an exchange rate of 100 DApp tokens for 1 Ethereum.

The project includes the usage of Truffle Suite and particularly Ganache to deploy a local blockchain.
Deployment and configuration is currently on localhost, and allows the user to connect their Metamask wallet via custom RPC and trade the tokens
